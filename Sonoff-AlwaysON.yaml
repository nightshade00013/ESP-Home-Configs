# This is a simple always on YAML for Sonoff Basic's.
# It works very well for a router, modem, or access point that you always want to be powered on
# but would like the ability to restart the device with a single action.  The way this is setup 
# you can trigger it to turn off but after the designated time it will power back on.  This is great 
# if the device is also your WiFi provider as if it is off you can not turn it back on without 
# direct user intervention.  This will allow you to trigger a reboot if a device is not functioning
# correctly even if you are not at home.  It also powers up the device automatically if you have a
# power outage.  You will want to set a static IP address outside of the DHCP range.
