# ESP-Home-Configs


Below is a list of the included YAML files for flashing ESP Home to your devices.  
You will want to makes some changes to the device names and settings but these YAML’s 
will allow you to set things up very quickly.  The Sonoff Basic will need to be 
flashed using a FTDI if they do not already have ESP Home or another firmware that 
has an upload functionality built in.  The Tuya Lightbulb’s will need a Linux based 
computer and software to upload using WiFi like Tuya Convert.

All files are provided AS-IS without warranty.

Here is a list of the files included as well as a simple description.


Sonoff-AlwaysON.yaml – This will allow you to use a Sonoff Basic (and possibly other 
ESP8266 devices) to control a device that you always want on but may need to reboot.  
I use this for routers, modems and WiFi Access Points.
